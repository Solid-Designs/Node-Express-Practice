I am doing this for fun. I would like to actually take the time to be creative
with my programming because I get really sick of sitting and watching tutorials.
So this is my opportunity to apply what I learned and go from there.

I figured out how to make it so that my controllers work on the routers.
- You do this by simply making the controllers the call back functions of each route.
- Make sure that you use the request and response objects as parameters in each function.
